# list-to-json
 The goal is to write something in javascript that can read a list from a website and parse it to json.
 
## Used for
 I want to use this to help me with making my [color game](https://github.com/dusthijsvdh/kleurenspel).
 Because it will need a lot of data I don't want to do it completly manually. On the site [kleurenwaaier.nl](https://www.kleurenwaaier.nl/bepaal-je-kleur/) there is a huge list with colours. To easily convert this to a usable json file I wanted to try something in javascript.
